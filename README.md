Community Network Monitor
========================

This is the code that extracts and parses the data coming from the open 
data set generated by three European wireless community networks.

It has been used for the paper "A week in the Life of three large
Wireless Community Networks" by Leonardo Maccari and Renato Lo Cigno, 
published in Elsevier Ad-Hoc Networks, currently available as a
preview at [this
link](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870514001474).

An improved version of the paper, with text and figure improvements can be found
[here](http://disi.unitn.it/maccari/CN).

If you use this code we appreciate if you cite the paper.
